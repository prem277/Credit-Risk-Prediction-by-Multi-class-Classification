# Credit-Risk-Prediction-by-Multi-class-Classification
Designed and implemented classification models to predict loan default risk in P2P lending platforms, developing multi-class (default, prepayment, non-default) prediction. Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and class balancing (for handling default imbalance), improving predictive accuracy across logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
